This is README.txt for group B's project of the deep learning class of the rutgers business school in spring 2020.

This project is running on keras_gpu, the gpu we use is RTX2080 with max_q design.

To run this program, you need to download the dataset https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/breast-histopathology-images in the local path "os.listdir('../input')".

Because the random seed and the running environment are different each time, the outputs has some difference in each running. That is why there exists some difference between our notebook and PPT.

Our group include: Junhui Liao ,Hanxin Hu and Shahana Rahaman. The indivdual responsibility:
	Liao: Construct four different CNN models, including VGG16, VGG13, Alexnet without two different dropout rates; 

	Hanxin: Data preparation and processing, organize discussion as well as combine slides;

	Shahana: Use data augmentation and CNN Resnet50 to improve out-of-sample performance.
