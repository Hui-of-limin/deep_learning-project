This is README.txt for group B's project of the deep learning class of the rutgers business school in 2020 spring.

This project is running on keras_gpu, the gpu we use is RTX2080 with max_q design.

To run this program, you need to download the dataset in the "os.listdir('../input')"

Because the random seed and the running environment are different each time, the output has some difference in each running. That is why the outputs are different
from our ipython and PPT.
