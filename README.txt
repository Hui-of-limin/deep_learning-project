This is README.txt for group B's project of the deep learning class of the rutgers business school in 2020 spring.

This project is running on keras_gpu, the gpu we use is RTX2080 with max_q design.

To run this program, you need to download the dataset https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/breast-histopathology-images in the local path "os.listdir('../input')".

Because the random seed and the running environment are different each time, the outputs has some difference in each running. That is why there exists some difference between our notebook and PPT.
